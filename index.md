## Robot

We will participate in OPL with two robots, HSR and AERO, customized with our own sensor boards and other components.

## Approaches

### Description of the approaches and information on scientific achievements

#### Development of self-made sensor boards
We have recently developed new self-made sensor boards as a culmination of previous research[1,2] in our laboratory to create and use sensor boards. This board is equipped with sensors such as proximity sensor, force sensor, microphone, and IMU. Therefore, the use of this sensor board is expected to contribute greatly to the improvement of various manipulation skills of the robots.

#### Language Use in Life Support Robots
Life support robots that coexist with humans must be able to interpret verbal instructions and perform tasks desired by humans in real environments. In addition, just as humans use language to acquire concepts and perform advanced thinking, robots should be able to use language to approximate some of the abilities that are taken for granted by humans but are still difficult for robots to perform.

#### Learning through daily continuation
It is also necessary to collect data while performing daily life support tasks, and to learn and improve task execution based on that data. This is a very challenging issue. Since there are two types of learning elements: global learning elements that are effective in multiple environments and local learning elements that are relevant to the unique circumstances of those environments, we believe it is important to successfully separate both types of learning and improve the system at various levels.

Soonhyo Kim  

#### Staff members
Iori Yanokura

### Previous participation in RoboCup

Although the team members have been replaced and are no longer a separate team, JSK has participated in the RoboCup@Home 2017 in Nagoya. The JSK team called JSK@Home proceeded to the finals showing great performance especially in the competition concerning speech and person recognition, scoring the highest of all teams.

### Participation and rankings in local RoboCup tournaments

Our team has never participated in a local RoboCup tournament and will participate in the Japanese domestic tournament to be held in March 2023.
